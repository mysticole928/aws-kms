AWS Key Management System CLI examples and samples

This repository holds CLI demos and tutorials that I've build to outline and explain the AWS Key Management System.  (AWS KMS)

It is designed to illustrate how the AWS KMS works.  In a production system, these tasks would be automated and be **much** more efficient.

* create-cmk.md - outlines the steps to create a Customer Master Key (CMK) from the command line
* kms.md - outlines the steps to use a CMK to encrypt and decrypt data in conjunction with `openssl`
